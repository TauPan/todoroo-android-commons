Todoroo Android Commons
-----------------------

Branches of this project act as git submodules you can clone and use
in your own project. Please see the attached LICENSE document for
licensing terms.

Each branch expects to be cloned within an Android project under the
following path:

    src/com/todoroo/commons/<branch_name>

For example, the data branch contains the data layer submodule. All
Java files within this project are under the package
com.todoroo.commons.data, meaning the base folder for the submodule
should be src/com/todoroo/commons/data. The specific git commands to
achieve this are (obviously replace "data" with the module you want):

    mkdir -p src/com/todoroo/commons/data
    git submodule add -b data \
        git://github.com/tim-todoroo/todoroo-android-commons.git \
        src/com/todoroo/commons/data
    git commit
